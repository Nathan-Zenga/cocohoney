            <h1>Meet The CEO</h1>
            <p>I began Cocohoney Cosmetics with the idea that the energy I bring fourth to my friends and
            family was something I wanted to spread. I want every women regardless of your shape,
            size or colour to feel alive and beautiful when they wear my product or attend one of my
            events. Although we are a cosmetics brand it about how you feel when you wear our
            product but more importantly what you feel within!</p>
            <p>I hope my brand touches you in one way or another. Whether you feel like a goddess
            wearing our products or if the vibe touches you and makes you feel confident within
            yourself! This is all I could ever ask for!</p>
